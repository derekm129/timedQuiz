# Timed Coding Quiz

## Description

- I was motivated by my desire to learn how HTML, CSS, and JS can be used to make an online quiz.
- I built this project so that I could have a functionable quiz that can keep score, track time, and save initials.
- This solved the problem of how to make a quiz that anyone can use to review basic coding concepts.
- I learned how event listeners, variables, and query selectors can be used to create an interactive webpage.
